# CluMPR_DESI
Python implementation of CluMPR algorithm, optimized for DESI Legacy Survey and Cori computer (NERSC). 

BEWARE: This code was written by me when I was (mostly) still an undergraduate....it is neither pretty nor efficient. It is done entirely in Jupyter notebooks and is not being actively maintained. However, do not hesitate to reach out to me if you are interested in running this algorithm on your dataset. This code can be a good starting point for your own implementation.
